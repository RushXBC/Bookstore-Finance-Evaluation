Bookstore Finance Evaluation

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of a bookstore chain’s financial and payroll data. The included SQL queries address:

* Revenue versus debt obligations – assessing quarterly net revenue relative to loan interest.
* Employee payroll and tenure – identifying longest-tenured staff and calculating cumulative gross pay.
* Payroll reconciliation – detecting discrepancies between payroll liabilities and recorded bank withdrawals.
* Store-level payroll insights – summarizing active employees and total gross payroll by location.

All scripts are implemented in T-SQL, designed to ensure accuracy in reporting and handle missing or incomplete data. The datasets include Employees, Payroll, Sales, Loans, and Checking Balanced Dataset.
